# ExHackers - My Attempt At Protohackers

Inspired by [Protohackers in Elixir][protohackers_in_elixir], I'm making an attempt at solveing the [Protohackers] network challenges, using Elixir.

## Running Locally

You can run this application locally by cloning the repository and running:

```shell
mix deps.get
mix run --no-halt
```

## Deploying

I'm deploying this application on [Fly.io][fly], at least for the moment.
